# Proust Bluesky Images

This repository is an archival collection of images used in scheduled Bluesky posts drawn from references in Marcel Proust’s *In Search of Lost Time*.  
It provides a stable, self-hosted source of images so that scheduled posts will not break if external links change or disappear.

## Contents
- **/images**: Book covers, artworks, trade cards, and other reference images
- **README.md**: This file, explaining the repository
- *(optional in future)* index.html for browsing images as a gallery

## Purpose
- Ensure **permanent, reliable URLs** for use in Bluesky posts
- Maintain a **long-term archive** of the visual references collected while reading
- Provide consistent naming and metadata for each image

## License
- Images are used for scholarly, archival, and reference purposes.  
- Public domain images are marked as such; modern covers remain © their respective publishers.
